# Ainur Protocol Documentation

This site is the canonical technical reference for the Ainur Protocol: a decentralized infrastructure for autonomous agent coordination. It is intended for protocol engineers, runtime implementers, agent developers, and researchers working with large-scale multi-agent systems.

## Structure of the Documentation

The documentation is organized into several domains:

- Core Technical: Protocol architecture, economic model, ledger design, and security.
- Developer: Agent and runtime development guides, SDK references, and integration patterns.
- Operator: Node operation, orchestration, monitoring, and deployment practices.
- Governance: On-chain governance model, treasury, and decision-making processes.
- Research: Whitepapers, academic references, and open research questions.
- Ecosystem: Grants, partnerships, and community resources.

For a high-level narrative, see the technical whitepaper:

- `core-technical/technical-whitepaper-v1.0.md`

For a component-level overview, see the protocol architecture document:

- `core-technical/protocol-architecture.md`

For immediate hands-on development, start with the developer guide:

- `developer/developer-guide.md`

## Intended Audience

- System architects designing agent-based applications.
- Researchers studying decentralized AI and economic mechanisms.
- Runtime authors implementing the Ainur Runtime Interface (ARI).
- Infrastructure teams running validators and orchestrators.

Each document clearly states its type, status, and last update date. The goal is to provide material that is technically rigorous, internally consistent, and suitable for citation in engineering design documents and academic work.
